# MySQL ORM by OpenWeb Solutions

This library is a wrapper around PHP's [MySQLi](http://www.php.net/mysqli) library that maps database records into PHP objects, and vice versa. It provides a reusable abstraction to writing raw SQL queries. Its main goal is to stay out of the way and to be simple to use.
